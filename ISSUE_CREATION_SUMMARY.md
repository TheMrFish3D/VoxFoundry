## üöÄ Issue Creation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure (IMMEDIATE)
**Create these issues first** - they are critical dependencies:

```bash
# Foundation Issues (Priority: Critical)
Issue #1: Initialize Monorepo Structure (2 days)
Issue #2: Development Environment Setup (1 day)  
Issue #3: Database Schema Implementation (2 days)
Issue #6: CI/CD Pipeline Setup (2 days)
```

**Agent Assignment**: DevOps/Setup Agent
**Total Effort**: ~7 days
**Dependencies**: None (can start immediately)

### Validation Checkpoint V1
**Create after Foundation completion**:
```bash
Project Setup Validation Checkpoint
- Validate foundation setup
- Update Copilot instructions  
- Assess readiness for Phase 2
```

### Phase 2-6: Subsequent Development Chunks
Issues for remaining phases are documented in DEVELOPMENT_ISSUES.md:
- **Phase 2**: Authentication & Core Services (Issues #4, #7, #8)
- **Phase 3**: EPUB Processing & AI Integration (Issues #5, #9-11)  
- **Phase 4**: Voice Management & Synthesis (Issues #12-17)
- **Phase 5**: Frontend Applications (Issues #18-20)
- **Phase 6**: Testing & Quality Assurance (Issues #21-23)

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use the Issue Creation System

### Option 1: GitHub CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Authenticate with GitHub CLI
gh auth login

# Create foundation issues
cd /home/runner/work/VoxFoundry/VoxFoundry
./scripts/create-github-issues.sh chunk1

# Create validation checkpoints  
./scripts/create-github-issues.sh validation

# Create all issues at once
./scripts/create-github-issues.sh all
```

### Option 2: Manual Creation
1. Navigate to GitHub repository issues page
2. Use templates from `github-issues/` directory
3. Copy title and labels from template headers
4. Copy body content for issue description

### Option 3: Node.js Script
```bash
# Generate issue templates
node scripts/create-issues.js --dry-run

# Check generated templates
ls github-issues/
```

## üìä Project Metrics

### Issue Breakdown by Phase
- **Foundation**: 4 issues (7 days effort)
- **Authentication**: 3 issues (7 days effort)
- **EPUB/AI**: 4 issues (13 days effort)
- **Voice**: 6 issues (19 days effort)  
- **Frontend**: 3 issues (12 days effort)
- **Testing**: 3 issues (12 days effort)
- **Validation**: 6 checkpoint issues (12 days effort)

**Total**: 29 issues, ~82 days of development effort

### Development Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Weeks 1-2 (Foundation)
- **Phase 2**: Weeks 3-4 (Authentication & Core)
- **Phase 3**: Weeks 5-8 (EPUB & AI Integration)
- **Phase 4**: Weeks 9-13 (Voice Management)
- **Phase 5**: Weeks 14-16 (Frontend)
- **Phase 6**: Weeks 17-18 (Testing & QA)

**Total Timeline**: ~18 weeks with validation checkpoints

## üéØ Next Steps for Project Manager

### Immediate Actions (Next 24 hours)
1. **Create Foundation Issues**: Use scripts to create Issues #1-3, #6
2. **Assign DevOps Agent**: Assign foundation issues to setup-capable agent
3. **Setup Project Board**: Create GitHub project board for tracking
4. **Prepare Environment**: Ensure agents have necessary access and tools

### Short-term Actions (Next Week)  
1. **Monitor Foundation Progress**: Track completion of Issues #1-3, #6
2. **Prepare Phase 2**: Ready authentication and core service issues
3. **Team Assembly**: Identify and onboard additional specialized agents
4. **Validation Planning**: Prepare for first validation checkpoint

### Medium-term Actions (Next Month)
1. **Chunk-by-Chunk Delivery**: Complete Phases 1-3 with validation
2. **Architecture Validation**: Ensure implementation matches design
3. **Quality Gates**: Maintain code quality and security standards
4. **Documentation Updates**: Keep Copilot instructions current

## üîç Quality Assurance Notes
