**Labels**: `epic:foundation`, `priority:critical`, `effort:2-days`, `chunk:foundation-infrastructure`

---

Set up the complete monorepo structure using Turborepo with all necessary packages, workspaces, and build configurations.

## 📦 Development Chunk

**Chunk**: Foundation & Infrastructure  
**Phase**: Critical setup tasks that must be completed before other work can begin  
**Priority**: Critical

## ✅ Tasks

- [ ] Initialize Turborepo configuration with proper caching
- [ ] Create all package directories per architecture document
- [ ] Set up package.json files for each workspace
- [ ] Configure TypeScript workspace references
- [ ] Set up ESLint and Prettier configurations across workspaces
- [ ] Create unified build and development scripts
- [ ] Configure Turbo pipeline for efficient builds
- [ ] Set up inter-package dependencies

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `npm install` installs all dependencies correctly
- [ ] `npm run build` builds all packages successfully
- [ ] `npm run dev` starts all development servers
- [ ] `npm run lint` lints all packages consistently
- [ ] TypeScript compilation works across all packages
- [ ] Shared packages can be imported by other packages
- [ ] Turbo caching improves build performance

## 📁 Files to Create/Modify

- `package.json` (root)
- `turbo.json`
- `packages/*/package.json`
- `tsconfig.json` (root and packages)
- `.eslintrc.js`
- `prettier.config.js`

## 🤖 Agent Guidance
