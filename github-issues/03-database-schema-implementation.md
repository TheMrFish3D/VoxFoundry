## 📊 Database Schema Overview

### Core Tables
- **users**: User accounts and authentication
- **books**: EPUB files and metadata
- **chapters**: Book chapter segmentation
- **characters**: Detected characters and dialogue
- **voice_profiles**: Voice profile definitions
- **audio_files**: Generated audio storage
- **acting_notes**: AI-generated performance notes

### Relationships
- Users → Books (one-to-many)
- Books → Chapters (one-to-many)
- Chapters → Characters (many-to-many)
- Characters → Voice Profiles (many-to-many)
- Chapters → Audio Files (one-to-many)

- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] No new security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Database migrations are reversible
