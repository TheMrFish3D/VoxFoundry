# Issue #6: CI/CD Pipeline Setup

**Labels**: `epic:foundation`, `priority:high`, `effort:2-days`, `chunk:foundation-infrastructure`

---

Configure GitHub Actions for automated testing, building, and deployment with proper quality gates and security scanning.

## 📦 Development Chunk

**Chunk**: Foundation & Infrastructure  
**Phase**: Critical setup tasks that must be completed before other work can begin  
**Priority**: High

## 🔗 Dependencies

This issue depends on: #1, #2, #3

## ✅ Tasks

- [ ] Create workflow for pull request validation
- [ ] Set up automated testing pipeline
- [ ] Configure Docker image building
- [ ] Set up staging deployment automation
- [ ] Add code coverage reporting
- [ ] Implement security scanning with CodeQL
- [ ] Set up dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Configure deployment environments
- [ ] Add deployment rollback capabilities
- [ ] Create workflow status notifications

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] PRs automatically run tests and linting
- [ ] Docker images build successfully
- [ ] Staging deployment works automatically
- [ ] Code coverage reports are generated
- [ ] Security scans detect vulnerabilities
- [ ] Deployment can be rolled back if needed
- [ ] Failed builds block merging
- [ ] Notifications are sent for build status

## 📁 Files to Create/Modify

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- `.github/workflows/security.yml`
- `Dockerfile` (for each service)
- `docker-compose.prod.yml`

## 🤖 Agent Guidance

- **Estimated Effort**: 2 days
- **Skills Required**: GitHub Actions, Docker, DevOps, Security
- **Testing Requirements**: CI/CD pipeline tests, deployment verification
- **Documentation**: Deployment guide, CI/CD documentation

## 🚀 Pipeline Workflows

### PR Validation Workflow
- **Trigger**: Pull request opened/updated
- **Steps**: 
  - Checkout code
  - Setup Node.js and dependencies
  - Run linting and type checking
  - Run unit tests
  - Generate code coverage
  - Build all packages
  - Security scanning

### Build and Deploy Workflow
- **Trigger**: Push to main branch
- **Steps**:
  - Run full validation
  - Build Docker images
  - Push to container registry
  - Deploy to staging environment
  - Run integration tests
  - Optional: Deploy to production

### Security Scanning Workflow
- **Trigger**: Daily scheduled, PR creation
- **Steps**:
  - CodeQL analysis
  - Dependency vulnerability scan
  - Container security scan
  - SAST/DAST security testing

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- [ ] Secrets management for API keys
- [ ] Container image security scanning
- [ ] Code quality gates
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability monitoring
- [ ] Access control for deployments
- [ ] Audit logging for deployments

## 📊 Quality Gates

- [ ] Code coverage > 80%
- [ ] No high-severity security vulnerabilities
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Linting and formatting compliance
- [ ] Docker images under size limits
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## ✅ Definition of Done

- [ ] All tasks completed and tested
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] No new security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline is reliable and fast
- [ ] Deployment process is documented and tested
